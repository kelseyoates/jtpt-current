        <h5>Jonathan</h5>
     <p>"I started attempting to lose weight when I was 9, in third grade. Over the next 7 years I had done countless weight loss programs from seeing doctors to body wraps and taking 12 different supplements every day. Nothing worked, and I was in the 99th percentile, or morbidly obese, for my age. Exercising was an issue for me, as I was so out of shape, and I began to accept that I would be overweight the rest of my life. In February of 2015 I met Jay, and from then on my life has completely turned around. Not only did Jay guide me as a trainer and ensure that I was exercising properly and effectively, he also pushed and motivated me so that I could accomplish something that I couldn't have ever dreamed about. Over the course of a year, I had lost 100 pounds and had gone from morbidly obese to being in the "normal" range. I had gone from having to be cautious about everything I ate and did and unable to do any exercise to being able to eat healthy and conscious choices and climb mountains, hike deserts, and exercise with ease. Jay has changed my life and I can honestly say that the miracle of the past year could not have been done had it not been for his intervention. Thank you Jay, thank you for making me into a completely new and healthy person who will live for many more years now that you have helped me turn my life around."</p>

He uses his knowledge of weight lifting, core stregthening and proper body mechanics to teach others how to get a safe and effective workout.</p> <p>"After working with Jay for the past 9 months I have lost almost 50 lbs. More importantly, I have been pain free for the past 6 months! I would recommend Jay Thebado anyone!”</p>

        <p>“In the several months that I've been training with Jay, I have learned to eat better, exercise more intelligently, and most importantly stay motivated. Getting fit is more enjoyable than ever, and I'm seeing the best results I've ever had when working out.</p><p>"Check out these accomplishments: I've dropped from a 42" waist to a 38" waist size I've dropped from a XXL shirt size to an XL shirt size I had to buy a smaller belt I'm getting more compliments and positive feedback on my appearance than I have in years Much higher self-esteem and confidence.</p><p>"It's taken a lot of hard work and commitment to get to this point, and I have more to go. But I've never been happier with my appearance or level of fitness!.”</p>

        <h5>Stacie</h5>
        <p>“My name is Stacie and I’ve trained with Jay Thebado for over 2 years. I lost about 45lbs in just 6 months.</p><p>"Jay taught me how to keep track of my food intake and helped me transition away from an unhealthy lifestyle (eating whatever I wanted, not exercising, and not caring about my health at all). From our first consultation up until today, Jay has been by my side, encouraging and motivating me to do my best for ME.</p><p>"Since we met, I have had extreme ups and downs spanning across various parts of my life and many times they have impacted my choices and feelings around my health and body image. Jay has consistently been there to teach and guide me on days when I felt like I couldn’t do that on my own. His personal training skills have changed the way I am able to strengthen myself, physically, mentally and emotionally.</p><p>"He has been able to teach me how to exercise the right way, showing me how my body should be positioned and how to avoid injury. More importantly, his passion for helping others help themselves has increased my positivity, my perception of who I am, and seeing a brighter future.</p><p>"I used to be quite negative about the way I viewed myself and too often felt hopeless. Jay has been a consistently positive part of my life as a personal trainer and friend for almost 5 years now. I know that he can and has served a great purpose in many lives, not only by teaching proper form and exercise through private and group training sessions, but also as a trainer who understand the challenges of his clients and continually being by their side always encouraging and motivating them to do what is best for them.”</p>
